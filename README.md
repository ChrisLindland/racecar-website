This github repo contains all the labs the 2019 TAs wrote for the BWSI Racecar program.

THE PROGRAMS, HOWEVER ARE IN ANOTHER REPO (cause you know, kids, public repo, solution code...). For any given lab, the associated starter code and/or solution code (when applicable) should be on the [2019-BWSI github repo](https://github.mit.edu/2019-BWSI/Writeups) in the corresponding directory within the "labs_programs" folder.

The labs are located in 4 phases. They are derived from the weeks of the BWSI course but they do not all exactly take up one week's worth of class time. They are ordered in order of decreasing student involvement, meaning earlier phases involve algorithms that students can and should master, while later phases involve increasingly impenetrable behemoths of code (concluding in machine learning) that students can only hope to use and not ever modify (within the scope of the class).

The resources folder contains installation instructions and cheatsheets from other years. We have brief writeups on hardware like the ZED camera, lidar, and the speakers. We also have installation and usage instructions on cartographer, arTags, and localization. Finally, there is a full docker setup writeup for running the racecar simulator.
