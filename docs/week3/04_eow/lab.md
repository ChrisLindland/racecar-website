# Rideshare Challenge

For this challenge, you are going to mimic a rideshare program with your car! There will be two sections in the track: a "pickup" area and a "drop-off" area. The pickup area will have an AR tag that will correspond to a set location in the drop-off area. You will have to localize using your map to reach the correct drop-off location. Once you reach your goal, you should return to the pickup area, where you will read a different tag and start the process again. This means that you will have to set both the drop-off location as a goal, as well as the starting location (the AR tag will always be in the same place). The AR tags correspond to locations as follows:

* 0:
* 1:
* 2:

There will also be obstacles in the track, so you will have to integrate your potential field control as well.
